# TodoAppReact
This is my first application I have built using React and ASP.NET. It's a simple Todo list application using the following technologies:

- React
- Azure SQL Server
- ASP.NET Core API
- NextUI

This is a work in progress and it isn't where I want it to be yet, but I am having a lot of fun building it!
